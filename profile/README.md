:musical_note: **Nabil Bouamara**

The coolest financial econometrician on earth. Have a look at his [website](https://nblbmra.github.io/).

:star: **Brecht Verbeken**

The coolest mathematician in economics. He doesn't have a website (but his research is [here](https://researchportal.vub.be/en/persons/brecht-verbeken)), so he is probably the biggest star of us all.

## WHAT
